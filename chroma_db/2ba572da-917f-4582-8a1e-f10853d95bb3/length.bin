Backpropagation , short for Backward Propagation of Errors, is a key algorithm used to train neural networks by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual outputs. It works by propagating errors backward through the network, using the chain rule of calculus to compute gradients and then iteratively updating the weights and biases. Combined with optimization techniques like gradient ...
